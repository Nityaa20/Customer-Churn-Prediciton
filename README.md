Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This project builds a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a banking dataset. Churn prediction helps businesses identify customers who are likely to leave, so they can take proactive steps to retain them.

ðŸ”‘ Key Features :

1.Data Preprocessing
Removed irrelevant columns (RowNumber, CustomerId, Surname).
Applied Label Encoding for categorical features (Gender, Geography).
Standardized numerical features for better model performance.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized churn distribution using count plots and pie charts.
Explored customer behavior patterns related to churn.

3.Machine Learning Models
Implemented Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier.

4.Compared models using metrics like:
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
ROC Curve & AUC Score

5.Performance Insights
Logistic Regression provided a baseline.
Random Forest improved prediction accuracy with better handling of nonlinear patterns.

ðŸ“Š Results :
The Random Forest model achieved higher ROC-AUC scores, making it more reliable for churn prediction.
The project provides visual insights into customer churn, highlighting important retention opportunities.

ðŸš€ Applications :
Banks and financial institutions can integrate this into their CRM systems.
Helps in customer retention strategies, personalized offers, and churn risk alerts.
